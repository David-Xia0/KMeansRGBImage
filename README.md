# KMeansRGBImage
131 Matlab Project (2018 sem 2)

## Project Goals

This was the first proper coding project assigned to us.
One of the main goals was using vectoristion in MATLAB to speed up calculations and processes. As well as, this being apart of our introduction into programming.

## Functionality

you import an image, and select the number of colors you want to transform that image into. In example, selecting 4 colors means the output image will only contain 4 colors that are the average of all the other colors.
